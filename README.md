# Drywall

A website and user system starter. Implemented with Express and Backbone.

## Technology

Server side, Drywall is built with the [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
framework. We're using [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as a data store.

The front-end is built with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/).
We're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for the asset pipeline.
